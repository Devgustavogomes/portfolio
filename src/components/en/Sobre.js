                    I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in web development and fullstack applications.
I’ve always been curious about how interfaces work behind the scenes, which led me to explore the world of programming more deeply.
I like to learn in a practical way: studying, testing ideas, and developing projects to apply what I’m discovering. I really value the process of building something from scratch, understanding each step, and improving gradually.
I’m still at the beginning of my journey, but I take my learning seriously. I’m constantly looking to grow, both technically and professionally.
I’m eager to participate in real projects, collaborate with other developers, and turn knowledge into experience.
